# Introduction

The Baseball players data provided this project in the link [Baseball Players](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud507/baseball_data.csv). In oreder to analyze, Baseball Players performance and deriving relatioonships between data, we used Tableau. The data insights has been gathered in the form of a story using worksheets, dashboards, and other tools provided in Tableau.

# Summary

Exploration of data usimg Tableau reveals that Home runs and Average don't depend on more Height or more Weight of a players.The best average lies between weight 137lb to 167lb, whereas best average for height lies between 63inches to 69inches, in which somehow height with 65 inches players have zero as their average. In general better average correspinds to better home run, however player with top average doesn't have top home run and player with top home runs doesn't have to average.

# Design

* First Attempt:
In the first attempt the variables used for the design Players with Top 10 Height, Weight, Average, Home Run and made conclusion based these three variables. Used all these three varaibles on Y-axis, and X-axis was used for Players Name to visualize records for each players.

Gradeint in bars for each chart was used to show each players average, and to show actual average as numbers to identify if top player in each category also has highest average.
 
After first review, there were many more improvements were needed and attempted in second version.
 
* Second Attempt:
 
In the second attemept, the height, weight varaibles were kept, however, checked for normal distribution and tried to find which bins correspond to more average. Also scatter plot for Home RUn and Average been to created to know if there is any correlation between them. 

Colors for bar chart, Pie Chart, Histograms, and Scatter plots are kept in in shades of blue to convey message instead of bright colors as most of the data remains in one category or two. Therefore shades and bins were able to categorize them without using different colors, to be able to analyze data for prolonged time.

Top 10 players with heighest averages and Home Runs along with their handedness details to convey if they are left handed or right handed, and which category of handedness most top players fall in. Handedness percentages were determined, to know if players with different handedness have similar averages or being left handed,both handed  or right handed plays a role in player's average.

The averages counts were tested if they are normally distributed, and what are the most common average for most players, how many players fall into the highest average bin, an lowest average bin.





# Feedback

* Attempt 1 Feedback No. 1

Slide #1

You can give name to the story instead of just “Story 1”

The size of the caption box is too small. You can increase the width and length of the caption. Like the one shown below.

I would suggest you full forms like ‘Left’ and ‘Right’ instead of ‘L’ and ‘R’. its easy to understand for readers. I also do not understand what is B? You can refer to image below.

It is not clear what is the second plot is all about

Slide #2

Here also instead of HR you can use Home Run.

I think gradient filter is not required as you already have Y scale for number of runs.

Slide #3

Here also gradient colors for bars may not be required.

Since you are trying to correlate height and weight with average…you could use the scatterplot instead of the bar chart.

Looks like you have so many worksheets but you have not included in your story.

* Attempt Feedback No. 2

You should focus on Aesthetic and communication. For example:  'Story 1' should be changed to more specific details to convey the information to users.
